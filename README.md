Implementation of the Hungarian Method in C
===========================================
This algorithm allows you to find the minimum weight matching of a bipartite graph. The graph can be of arbitrary size and connectedness. The edge weights are captured by a MxN weight matrix where an infinite(Inf) weight designates that that pair of vertices given by that position are not connected.
